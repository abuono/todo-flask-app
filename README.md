# TODO-Flask-app

This app is currently in beta phase, but I'm working on some adjustments such as updating the task and other details.

Stay tuned! :)

#### To install the requirements run the following command on your Python virtual environment:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And then, execute the command ```python3 app.py```

Regards.
